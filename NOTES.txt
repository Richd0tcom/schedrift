SEVERITY NOTES

TABLE



COLUMNS
- Making a column NOT NULL is more severe than making it nullable
- Type changes are often high severity depending on the change
- Removing a column is high severity
- Adding a NOT NULL column is high severity

column breaking changes
- Different type families are usually breaking


PARSE NOTES

Comments in SQL continue until line terminates so you can parse/remove them by \n
Be careful about semicolons within strings while parsing
Split Table definition by commas, but respect parentheses and quotes
