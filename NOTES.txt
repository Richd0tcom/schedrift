SEVERITY NOTES

TABLE



COLUMNS
- Making a column NOT NULL is more severe than making it nullable
- Type changes are often high severity depending on the change
- Removing a column is high severity
- Adding a NOT NULL column is high severity

column breaking changes
- Different type families are usually breaking


PARSE NOTES

Comments in SQL continue until line terminates so you can parse/remove them by \n
Be careful about semicolons within strings while parsing
Split Table definition by commas, but respect parentheses and quotes


Loader notes
Schema file likelyhood ranking:
1. Prefer files with "schema" in the name. score = 10
2. Prefer files named exactly "schema.sql". score = 20
3. Prefer files in certain directories (db, database). score =5
4. Penalize files in migrations directories (usually incremental changes). score = -5
5. Prefer larger files (more likely to be complete schemas). score = 3 or 1 depending o size

File is likely a schema file if it has multiple schema-related keywords

sort score by highest first
